PROBLEM 1

A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent

of the property’s actual value. If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment

value is $6,000. The property tax is then 75C for each $100 of the assessment value.

The tax for the acre assessed a t $6,000 will be $45. Write a program that asks for the

actual value of a piece of property, then displays the assessment value and property tax.

In your calculations for your output screenshot, use the value of $100,000 as the user’s input.

PROBLEM 2

Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. Here are the details of

the purchase:

<ul>

 <li>The number of shares that Joe purchased was 1,000.</li>

 <li>When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $45.50 per share.</li>

 <li>Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 2 percent of the amount</li>

</ul>

he paid for the stock.

Two weeks later, Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:

<ul>

 <li>The number of shares that Joe sold was 1,000.</li>

 <li>He sold the stock for $56.90 per share.</li>

 <li>He paid his stockbroker another commission, that amounted to 2 percent of the</li>

</ul>

amount he received for the stock.




Write a program that displays the following information:

<ul>

 <li>The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.</li>

 <li>The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.</li>

 <li>The amount that Joe sold the stock for.</li>

 <li>The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when be sold the stock.</li>

 <li>Display the amount of profit that Joe made after selling bis stock and paying the</li>

</ul>

two commissions to his broker. (If the amount of profit that your program displays

is a negative number, then Joe lost money on the transaction.)

In your output screenshot use the actual numbers provided to display the amount of profit Joe made.
